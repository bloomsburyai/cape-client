Cape API Python Client Library
==============================

Cape is an API that makes it easy to build software that answers questions about the contents of documents.
For example, you can use cape to:

* Build a super-powered ctrl+f that finds the answer to questions like 'Who is the CFO?', rather than just all the occurrences of a keyword.
* Build an expressive query tool for textual data - extract features with a single question.
* Build a virtual office assistant that answers routine questions through Slack.
* Build an add-on to your private search that mimics Google's 'direct answers'.
