# Cape API Client Module

Cape is an API from Bloomsbury AI that makes it easy to build software that answers questions about the contents of documents. For example, you can use cape to:

Build a super-powered ctrl+f that finds the answer to questions like ‘Who is the CFO?’, rather than just all the occurrences of a keyword.
Build an expressive query tool for textual data - extract features with a single question.
Build a virtual office assistant that answers routine questions through Slack.
Build an add-on to your private search that mimics Google’s ‘direct answers’.
